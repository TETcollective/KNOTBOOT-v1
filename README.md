## Description

KNOTBOOT introduces a bootstrap paradox interpretation of anomalies observed in interstellar objects 1I/‘Oumuamua (2017) and 3I/ATLAS (2025). These objects are proposed as self-consistent messengers from a future Type III civilization (ourselves, evolved ∼20,000 years) operating in an entangled cosmic hyperplane.

Topological invariants (linking number Lk=3 → trefoil knot → Ising anyon θ = 6π/5) encode the message.

## Description

KNOTBOOT proposes a bootstrap paradox interpretation of anomalies in interstellar objects (1I/‘Oumuamua and 3I/ATLAS). These are viewed as self-consistent messengers from a future Type III civilization operating in an entangled cosmic hyperplane. Topological invariants (linking number Lk=3 → trefoil knot → Ising anyon θ = 6π/5) encode the message.

The project evolves version by version:
- v1: core framework
- v1.1: black-hole equations + first simulations
- v1.2: ER=EPR/AdS/CFT wormholes + anyonic braiding

Future versions will explore traversability, quantum error correction, fractal structures and technological implications.
