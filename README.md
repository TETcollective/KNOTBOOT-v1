## Description

KNOTBOOT introduces a bootstrap paradox interpretation of anomalies observed in interstellar objects 1I/‘Oumuamua (2017) and 3I/ATLAS (2025). These objects are proposed as self-consistent messengers from a future Type III civilization (ourselves, evolved ∼20,000 years) operating in an entangled cosmic hyperplane.

Topological invariants (linking number Lk=3 → trefoil knot → Ising anyon θ = 6π/5) encode the message.
